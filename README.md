# Nodejs-API-Tasks

Rest API for tasks management. Developed using Nodejs.

Technology stack used:
SQLite3, to install: npm i sqlite3 --save

Sequelize is an ORM, Object Relational Mapping, to install: npm install --save sequelize

To ensure that Sequelize connection will be instantiated only once, we adopt the Singleton pattern.
